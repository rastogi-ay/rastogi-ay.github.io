                Hello! My name is Ayush Rastogi. I’m a third-year student at Northeastern University 
                studying Computer Science and Business Administration. I’m originally from Hillsborough, 
                New Jersey. Some of my favorite hobbies are playing basketball, board games, and poker. A
                fun memory I’ve had recently is when I went to the Travis Scott concert, which you can 
                see a picture of on this website. A fun fact about me is that I’m the oldest in my 
                generation on my mom’s side of the family– in fact, the youngest relative in the 
                generation above me is only 4 years older than me! (yes, she’s still my aunt).
